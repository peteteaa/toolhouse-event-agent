Loveable prompts I used
Prompt 1

Build a chatbot interface similar to ChatGPT.

The main message input should be a text area named 'var1' with a placeholder that says "Var1".

Make sure there are smaller inputs for these fields: field name: 'var2' (labeled "Var2"), field name: 'var3' (labeled "Var3").
These inputs are required to be filled out before the user can send their first message. They are not required for subsequent messages.

When the user types Enter on their first message, call POST https://agents.toolhouse.ai/268765c0-d0bf-4f9c-974b-2b4af11958b5 with a JSON body that looks like this: { "vars": { "field_name": "value for this field", "other_field_name": "value for this field", ... } }

The request will return an X-Toolhouse-Run-ID header. Save it in the runId variable.

On any subsequent user message, call PUT https://agents.toolhouse.ai/268765c0-d0bf-4f9c-974b-2b4af11958b5/runId with this JSON body: { "message": "the user message from var1" }

Note that both endpoints will stream the response back to you in chunks, so you must show each chunk as it arrives. The streaming response will be in Markdown, so make sure to format so it displays nicely.

{ "message": "send an email with the last searched event to var1" }
